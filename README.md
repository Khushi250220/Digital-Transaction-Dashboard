# 📊 PhonePe Transaction Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end Power BI dashboard** built to analyze **PhonePe digital transactions** across multiple services such as **Recharge, Insurance, Loans, and Money Transfers**.

The dashboard provides clear insights into **transaction amounts, success vs failure rates, monthly trends, and failure reasons**, helping understand user behavior and payment performance.

I am transitioning into a **Data Analyst role** to explore new skills, work with data-driven insights, and build impactful analytical solutions through hands-on projects like this.
